# TwoThreeTree

Fairly textbook implementation of a 2-3 tree, where every item in the tree is contained in a leaf node and all leaf nodes
are at the same height.

Not a full implementation, since deletions haven't yet been added. I'll get around to it eventually.

When an entry being added already exists, there's a merge function that can be run.

It might be nice to return the actual leaf and/or node when an item has been added.
